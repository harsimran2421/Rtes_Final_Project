So the wolf showed his teeth and said:

    "Then I'll huff 
        and I'll puff 
            and I'll blow your house down."
            So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! The wolf was greedy and he tried to catch both pigs at once, but he was too greedy and got neither! His big jaws clamped down on nothing but air and the two little pigs scrambled away as fast as their little hooves would carry them.

            The wolf chased them down the lane and he almost caught them. But they made it to the brick house and slammed the door closed before the wolf could catch them. The three little pigs they were very frightened, they knew the wolf wanted to eat them. And that was very, very true. The wolf hadn't eaten all day and he had worked up a large appetite chasing the pigs around and now he could smell all three of them inside and he knew that the three little pigs would make a lovely feast.
So the wolf knocked on the door and said:

    "Little pigs! Little pigs!
        Let me in! Let me in!"
        But the little pigs saw the wolf's narrow eyes through the keyhole, so they answered back:

            "No! No! No! 
                Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!"
